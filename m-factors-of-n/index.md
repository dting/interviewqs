# Problem

```javascript
/**
 * Return an array of m length arrays that are factors of n
 *
 * Each nested array should should be equal to n when the
 * elements of the array are multiplied.
 */
function mFactorsOfN(n, m) {
  // Your code
}
```

# Example

```
For n = 12 and m = 3, mFactorsOfN should be:
[
  [1, 1, 12],
  [1, 2, 6],
  [1, 3, 4],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
```
